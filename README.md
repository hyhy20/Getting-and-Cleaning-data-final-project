# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-final-project


This is the final project for Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data".


Basically, it is a data collected by UCI, and is about an experiment set to test the wearable devices of Samsung.


In the R script "run_analysis.R", I: 

    1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 

    2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

    3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

    4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

    5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Also, I have comments in the script to guide you in case you need some detailed information 


In the output.txt, you will find a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


If you have difficulty in understanding the meaning of variable, you can find some instructions in codebook.


Hope you enjoy it!
